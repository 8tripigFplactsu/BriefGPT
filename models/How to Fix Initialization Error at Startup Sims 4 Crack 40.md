## Solution 1: Install or Update VC Redist
 
VC Redist is a package of Microsoft Visual C++ redistributable libraries that are required by many applications and games. If you have an outdated or missing VC Redist, you may encounter initialization errors when launching The Sims 4. To fix this, you need to uninstall any existing VC Redist versions from your computer and then install the latest ones from the official Microsoft website. Here are the steps:
 
1. Go to Control Panel > Programs and Features and look for any entries that start with "Microsoft Visual C++". Uninstall them one by one.
2. Restart your computer.
3. Download and install the latest VC Redist versions from these links: [VC Redist x86](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe) and [VC Redist x64](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).
4. Restart your computer again.
5. Try launching The Sims 4 and see if the error is gone.

## Solution 2: Copy the Crack Files Correctly
 
If you downloaded The Sims 4 from CODEX or FitGirl, you need to copy the crack files from the CODEX folder to the game installation folder. The crack files are usually located in CODEX\\Game\\Bin and CODEX\\Game\\Bin\_LE subfolders. You need to copy all three files from each subfolder and paste them into the corresponding subfolders in your game installation folder. For example, if you installed the game in D:\\Games\\The Sims 4 Snowy Escape, you need to copy the files from CODEX\\Game\\Bin to D:\\Games\\The Sims 4 Snowy Escape\\Game\\Bin and so on. Here are the steps:

1. Open the folder where you downloaded The Sims 4 from CODEX or FitGirl.
2. Open the CODEX folder and then open the Game folder.
3. Copy all three files from the Bin subfolder.
4. Open the folder where you installed The Sims 4.
5. Open the Game folder and then open the Bin subfolder.
6. Paste the files that you copied and replace any existing files.
7. Repeat steps 3 to 6 for the Bin\_LE subfolder.
8. Try launching The Sims 4 and see if the error is gone.

## Solution 3: Download Language Files
 
If you are trying to play The Sims 4 in a language other than English, you may need to download additional language files for the game. CODEX releases are English only, so if you want to play in another language, you need to download the language files from a trusted source and copy them into your game installation folder. For example, if you want to play in French, you need to download the French language files and copy them into D:\\Games\\The Sims 4 Snowy Escape\\Data\\Client (or wherever you installed the game). Here are the steps:

1. Go to this link: [The Sims 4 Troubleshooting Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/eskpgu/the_sims_4_troubleshooting_guide/).
2. Scroll down to the section "Initialization error at start up ...0000075:...".
3. Click on the link that says "Download language files". 0f148eb4a0
